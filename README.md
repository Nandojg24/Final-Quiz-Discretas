# ðŸ“š Final Quiz - Discrete Mathematics II (Regex and Automata)

This project is part of the final assignment for the course **Discrete Mathematics II** at Universidad del Valle, under the Faculty of Engineering, School of Systems and Computing Engineering.

## ðŸ“‹ Activities Overview

### âœ… 1. Regex in Code
- A custom program will be developed in Python.
- This program will load the `.txt` document and extract:
  - Interrogative and exclamatory sentences
  - Abbreviations

### âœ… 2. AFD Simulation
- Design a **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)** to simulate the access control system of a fictional university library called **BuPen**.
- The DFA will model:
  - System states from OFF to verifying card
  - Accepting valid cards
  - Rejecting invalid cards
- Deliverables include a transition table, state graph (PDF), and programmatic simulation.
